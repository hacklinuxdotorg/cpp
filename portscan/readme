questions:
Converting _TCHAR* to char*
The quickest solution is to just change the signature to the standard one. Replace:
int _tmain( int argc, _TCHAR* argv[] )
With
int main( int argc, char *argv[] )
This does mean on Windows that the command line arguments get converted to the system's 
locale encoding and since Windows doesn't support UTF-8 here not everything converts correctly. 
However unless you actually need internationalization then it may not be worth your time to do anything more.
